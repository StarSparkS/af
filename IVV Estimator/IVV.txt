Now that we have:

    Randy's 3 bins (IV&V, SwA, Acq),
    Gordon's 4 bins (Control, Must, Nice, Like)
    Jerita's 26 bins (report card)
    My bins (Red, White, Blue)
    Code CSCI bins,

Please craft a python script and/or excel sheet, like the autoti one, that will

    1. Given report card ratios
    2. Given SLOC, complexity, and % reuse tables by program & CSCI
    3. Given major facility upgrades costs by FY
    4. Given an average FTE for each Red, White, Blue
    5. Given a fixed budget from the POM cycle

Then, when Randy gives a funding cap by FY:

    1. Provide Labor, Travel, Material by FY
    2. Cost increase beyond controls by FY

Also, If funding is not an issue, the what is the 3,5,7,9,11,13,15 year plan?

Good luck,

Jim
